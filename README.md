# PLSport

Visit http://lancelotpoulin.com/projects to find more informations/demo about this (in french (google traduction it)).

A mobile application to manage a sport hall: seances between coachs and clients.

Xamarin application is the PLSport folder and the PHP webservice is the WebService folder (the .mwb or .sql for the MySQL database).

I think you should create new project and copy my files to avoid bugs of visual studio and xamarin. To use the code, you need to install some NuGet packages corresponding to unfindables "using" directives like "LusoVU.XamarinUsbSerialForAndroid.0.2.3" or "Plugin.CurrentActivity.1.0.1" etc... The application is connected to a webservice to log users, you can just delete this page or use the webservice and database in a WAMP server.
